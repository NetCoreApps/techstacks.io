      "description": "OrmLite's is a Simple, Fast, Typed ORM that provides a convenient, DRY, config-free, RDBMS-agnostic typed wrapper retaining a high affinity with SQL, exposing intuitive APIs that generate predictable SQL and maps cleanly to (DTO-friendly) disconnected POCO's. This approach makes easier to reason-about your data access making it obvious what SQL is getting executed at what time, whilst mitigating unexpected behavior, implicit N+1 queries and leaky data access prevalent in Heavy ORMs.",
