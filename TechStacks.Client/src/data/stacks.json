They also open up a number of new use-cases for maintaining clean isolation between front-end and back-end development with front-end developers not needing any knowledge of C#/.NET to be able to develop UIs for high-performance .NET Web Apps. Web Apps also make it easy to establish and share an approved suite of functionality amongst multiple websites all consuming the same back-end systems and data stores.\r\n\r\nWeb Apps leverages Templates to develop entire content-rich, data-driven websites without needing to write any C#, compile projects or manually refresh pages - resulting in the easiest and fastest way to develop Web Apps in .NET!\r\n\r\n## [Redis Vue](http://templates.servicestack.net/docs/web-apps#redis-vue)\r\n\r\nRedis UI was developed as a Single Page App as it provides a more optimal and responsive UX by only loading the HTML page once on Startup then utilizes Ajax to only download and update the incremental parts of the App's UI that needs changing.\r\n\r\nInstead of using jQuery and server-side HTML this version has been rewritten to use [Vue](https://vuejs.org) where the UI has been extracted into isolated Vue components utilizing [Vue X-Templates](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#X-Templates) to render the App on the client where all Redis Vue's functionality is contained within the [Redis/app/index.html](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Redis/blob/master/app/index.html) page.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Simple Vue App\r\n\r\nTemplates also provides a great development experience for Single Page Apps which for the most part gets out of your way letting you develop the Single Page App as if it were a static `.html` file, but also benefits from the flexibility of a dynamic web page when needed.\r\n\r\nThe containing [_layout.html](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Redis/blob/master/app/_layout.html) page can be separated from the [index.html](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Redis/blob/master/app/index.html) page that contains the App's functionality, where it's able to extract the title of the page and embed it in the HTML `<head/>` as well as embed the page's `<script />` in its optimal location at the bottom of the HTML `<body/>`, after the page's blocking script dependencies:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n<title>{{ title | default('Redis Vue WebApp') }}</title>\r\n{{ ifDebug | select: <script>{ '/js/hot-loader.js' | includeFile }</script> }}\r\n\r\n...\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../assets/css/bootstrap.css\">\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../assets/css/default.css\">\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n    <h2 id=\"title\"><a href=\"/\"><img src=\"/assets/img/redis-logo.png\" /> {{ title }}</a></h2>\r\n\r\n    {{ page }}\r\n\r\n    <script src=\"../assets/js/html-utils.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"../assets/js/vue{{ '.min' | if(!debug) }}.js\"></script>\r\n    <script src=\"../assets/js/axios.min.js\"></script>\r\n    \r\n    {{ scripts | raw }} \r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRedis Vue avoids the complexity of adopting a npm build system by refrencing Vue libraries as a simple script include:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"../assets/js/vue{{ '.min' | if(!debug) }}.js\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere it uses the more verbose and developer-friendly [vue.js](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Redis/blob/master/app/assets/js/vue.js) during development whilst using the production optimized [vue.min.js](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Redis/blob/master/app/assets/js/vue.min.js) for deployments. So despite avoiding the complexity tax of an npm-based build system it still gets some of its benefits like conditional deployments and effortless [hot reloading](http://templates.servicestack.net/docs/hot-reloading).\r\n\r\n### Server Templates\r\n\r\nWhilst most of [index.html](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Redis/blob/master/app/index.html) is a static Vue app, templates is leveraged to generate the body of the `<redis-info/>` Component on the initial home page render:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/x-template\" id=\"redis-info-template\">\r\n<div id=\"redis-info\">\r\n    <table class=\"table table-striped\" style=\"width:450px\">\r\n        <tbody>\r\n{{ redisInfo | toList \r\n   | select: <tr><th>{it.Key}</th><td title=\"{it.Value}\">{ it.Value | substringWithElipsis(32) }</td></tr> }}\r\n        </tbody>\r\n    </table>\r\n</div>\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis technique increases the time to first paint by being able to render the initial Vue page without waiting for an Ajax call response whilst benefiting from improved SEO from server-generated HTML.\r\n\r\n### Server Handling\r\n\r\nAnother area Templates is used is to handle the HTTP POST where it calls the `redisChangeConnection` filter to change the current Redis connection before rendering the [connection-info.html](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Redis/blob/master/app/connection-info.html) partial with the current connection info:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{{ ifHttpPost | use({ host, port, db, password }) | withoutEmptyValues | redisChangeConnection | end }}\r\n<script type=\"text/x-template\" id=\"connection-template\">\r\n{{ 'connection-info' | partial({ redis: redisConnection }) }}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Vue Ajax Server APIs\r\n\r\nAll other Server functionality is invoked by Vue using Ajax to call one of the Ajax APIs below implemented as [API Pages](http://templates.servicestack.net/docs/api-pages):\r\n\r\n#### [search.html](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Redis/blob/master/app/api/search.html)\r\n\r\nCalled when searching for Redis keys where the query is forwarded to the redisSearchKeys filter:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{{ limit | default(100) | assignTo: limit }}\r\n{{ q     | default('')  | assignTo: q }}\r\n\r\n{{ q     | append(\"*\") | redisSearchKeys({ limit }) \r\n         | return }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### [call.html](https://github.com/NetCoreWebApps/Redis/blob/master/app/api/call.html)\r\n\r\nCalled to execute an arbitrary Redis command on the connected instance, with the response from Redis is returned as a plain-text HTTP Response:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n{{ { command } | ensureAllArgsNotEmpty }}\r\n\r\n{{ ['flush','monitor','brpop','blpop'] | any: contains(lower(command), it)\r\n   | assignTo: illegalCommand }}\r\n\r\n{{ illegalCommand | ifThrowArgumentException('Command is not allowed.') }}\r\n\r\n{{ command  | redisCall | assignTo: contents }}\r\n\r\n{{ contents | return({ 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }) }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe benefits of using API Pages instead of a normal C# Service is being able to retain Web App's productive development workflow where the entire Redis Vue App is built without requiring any compilation.\r\n\r\n### Deep linking and full page reloads\r\n\r\nThe Redis Vue Single Page App also takes advantage of HTML5's `history.pushState` API to enable deep-linking and back-button support where most UI state changes is captured on the query string and used to initialize the Vue state on page navigation or full-page reloads where it proivdes transparent navigation and back-button support that functions like a traditional Web App but with the instant performance of a Single Page App.\r\n\r\n",

It should be able to run any application (and in the world of the Web, applications can be very wild things). So this requires at the same time much rocket surgery and much resilience and robustness. We tend to go to the true and tested for everything that a cluster depends on at runtime, while we allow ourselves to use more bleeding edge stuff when if ever it breaks it will not affect running client instances.\n\nOur orchestration layer is in Python relying heavily on Zookeeper to keep order in the chaos of multi-datacenter operations and tens of thousands of services running in each cluster. Everything that goes through each request is written in Golang because speed.\n\nWe are also very much dependent on Ceph to create some of our more \"magicky\" features, like being able to clone a running cluster in under a minute .. and Kafka to keep information flowing throughout the system. InfluxDB gives us precious metrics so our infrastructure can react to interesting changes in usage patterns. And the ELK stack is used to analyse our consumption charges on the different clouds we deploy to.",
